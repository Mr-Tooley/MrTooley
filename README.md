Python based modular tools framework.

Build tools. Connect them. Automate things.


## Status
A mess. Conceptional phase. Does not work yet.


## Components

### core
The core functionality. Can be imported and run from other Python programs.

### cli
Command line interface

### ui
PySide6 GUI

### web
An HTML frontend. Lower priority but I want it.

### tools
Official set of tools

## Roadmap / TODOs
- Tool structure, interfaces, persistence
- Namespaces/scopes for tools
- Some more tools to test the concepts and interfaces
- Connecting tools
- Signing / PGP, web of trust
- Git based versioning of single tools
- Tool isolation, not only for elevated user execution
- ui, cli and then a web frontend
- User auth at most for web frontend.
- Unified simple widgets and helpers for data access to be used in ui, cli and web.
- Integrity checks


## My own tools ideas
- Project based network documentation and monitoring
- Configuring system services and applications
- Unified device discovery and device information for products of various manufacturers. 
- Format converters
- SSH remote tooling
